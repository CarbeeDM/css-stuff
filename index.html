                <h3>Targeting player weaknesses, and why you probably shouldn't</h3>
            <p> From targeting the muscular knight with meental attacks, to targeting the wizard with physical challanges,
                one of the most useful tools for creating equal amounts of terror and excitement in your players is 
                recognizing what they cant fight against, and placing a monster that fills the quota.</p>
            <p> Perhaps a dragon that stays flying above the knife wielding rogue, or a golem that is coincidentally immune to the sorcerer's blinding tacitcs. Whatever it takes, You put it against the player(s) and manage to make them feel useless. 
                And...that is where the problems begin. The main goal of targeting a weakness, is to show the player that "they are not above others", its to showcase the stakes. how the world has fish quite a lot bigger than them. 
                But, used in abundance, it tells the player a whole different story. It tells them "you are not special or strong", it says "whatever you try, the world will throw some monster that you couldnt plan against to remind you that you arent cool".
                It stops being a terrifying moment where the legendary hero meets their match, but instead becomes a frankly frustrating moment of feeling useless. And this takes its toll on the story, if the player is bashed over the head with reminders
            of how everything outclasses them, then when you say "oh dear player, only you can save the city", it wont be believable.</p>
            <p>So what do you do instead? Well, it is no lie that a lot of players like being challanged, but not in a way that feels unfair. You want to give them a good confidence boost, so that the player thinks of themselves as the strongest person in team good guys, that only they can handle the dark lord of the week.
                Instead of looking at their weaknesses, direct your attention at their strengths. Sure, the knight can take a lot of damage and keep fighting, the wizard can throw large fireballs, and rogue can punish an enemy who has a moment of vulnnerability. But they still have their limits my reader.
                The knight can only take so much damage, so if you pick a monster that deals enough damage to scare the knight(but enough to make them think their investment in that shiny armor was a mistake), 
                then you will hear a different tale. "Even the knight is struggling against this thing! Everyone, run and hide, if it can hurt the knight, we dont stand a chance! Our only hope is the cool and amazing player managing to defeat the monster that only they can survive against!" the villagers and other players exclaim,
                and in that moment, The Knight will feel legendary and worthy of being the protagonist even as they panic over their rapidly declining hp.
            </p>
            <p> So next time when you're picking a challange, ask yourself if you give the players enough time to enjoy some pride and glory.</p>

                <h3>Important but overlooked difference about boss dungeons</h3>
            <p> So you are finally here, at the end of a long journey of trials and tribulations, your playerrs defeated many bandits, slain powerful beasts, and tackled that annoying rat problem of old lady Susan.
                And now, they are on their final task. Bust down the doors of the dragon's cave(metaphorically), battle through the hordes of minions and draw steel againsst the winged tyrant, in a fight to determine the fate of the land.
                You spend weeks designing the dragon and the arena, excitedly telll them to "go ahead", your players make it to the dragon, the big monologue is given, and the fight... does not go as you hoped.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your players enter the room battered, from all the minions youu put in, and then the dragon swoops in and finishes them off. "Thats not how this should go!" you tell yourself,
                so you change things up, clearly the dragon was too strong, so you make it weaker, have people test it again and... now it feels bad for entirely different reasons. With the danger toned down, it suddenly feels less dramatic than you had hoped. players enter the room battered, and the dragon stands proud and healthy, then the players defeat it. 
                Sure they struggle but, you cant help but shake the feeling that had the players not been battered, this wouldve been a cakewalk. Was this truly the terrifying foe you built up all game? One that your players use only 10% of their power to defeat? No. Certainly not. Something is terribly wrong here. You had been making dungeons for all sorts of quests, but now your normal ways are not working.
                <br> So, you return the dragon to full power, and just drop a convinient healing supply to loot just outside the boss room but... it doesnt feel elegant. 
                "Pre-Boss healing" is such a common thing that developers do that it has become a running joke among the public. It will take the players out of the moment, ruin the immersion, and even if it doesnt, dear reader, wont there be a nagging feeling that the players were not strong enough to save the day on their own? That they needed to down healing potions nonstop and beat the boss that way?
            </p>
            <p>
                What typically gets overlooked in designing a dungeon, is that there is certain amount of "fight" your players can handle before they need to run back to a safe zone.
                In a typical dungeon, that is no trouble. You can adjust individuals encounters and because there is no grand plot beat, all you need is that the fight in the dungeon is no more than the fight your players can take.
                However, when designing a boss dungeon, you have a narrative beat to worrk with. One that demands that it takes a lot of "fight" out of the players. having rest of the dungeon be the regular challange level will result in the overall fight in the dungeon exceeding the fight the players can take.
                As a result, you are forced to step back and do something that you normally mostly do without noticing. analyze how much fight your players have in them, and then distribute it through the dungeon, starting from the climactic boss fight. that way, you can ensure the big dragon and the legendary heroes can have a fairly equal 1v1.
